# AI Projects

This repository catalogs artificial intelligence projects, created to help me learn the implementation, behavior, and real-world applications of different models through hands-on experience.

## Models

### Implemented
- [Softmax Regression](https://github.com/POACH3/Softmax-Regression) - a probabilistic linear classifier for multi-class prediction
- [MENACE](https://github.com/POACH3/MENACE) - a reinforcement learning agent for very small state spaces
- [Lookahead Search](https://github.com/POACH3/Connect-Four) - a rudimentary search in a larger state space

### In Progress
- [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/POACH3/PolyEvolve-2D) - a solution approximator inspired by natural selection

### Planned
- Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Markov Decision Process
- Hidden Markov Model
- Q-Learning
- Bayesian Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
