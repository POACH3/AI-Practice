# AI Practice

The intent of this project is to better understand the implementation, behavior, and applications of a variety of artificial intelligence models through practical exposure. 

### Models Implemented
- [Softmax Regression](https://github.com/POACH3/AI-Practice/blob/main/supervised/softmax_regression.py) - a probabilistic linear classifier for multi-class prediction

### Models In Progress
- [MENACE (Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine)](https://github.com/POACH3/AI-Practice/tree/main/reinforcement/MENACE) - a reinforcement learning agent for very small state spaces
