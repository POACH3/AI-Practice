# AI Practice

This repository catalogs my artificial intelligence projects, created to help me learn through hands-on experience the implementation, behavior, and real-world applications of different models.

## Models

### Implemented
- [Softmax Regression](https://github.com/POACH3/Softmax-Regression) - a probabilistic linear classifier for multi-class prediction
- [MENACE (Machine Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine)](https://github.com/POACH3/MENACE) - a reinforcement learning agent for very small state spaces

### In Progress
- [Genetic algorithm](https://github.com/POACH3/PolyEvolve-2D) - using natural selection to approximate solutions

### Planned
- Markov Decision Process
- Hidden Markov Model
- Q-Learning
- Bayesian Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
